## This is the sample codes of my lecture
I made a lecture about TensorFlow(the popular deep learning framework)
before I leave college.
## the pdf file denotes what I am going to talk about
## Source Code Contains
### hello_world.py
```
    see 'hello world' by TensorFlow
```

### matrix_mult.py
```
   see how to execute computation by TensorFlow
```

### linear_regression.py
```
    linear regression is one of the simplest machine learning algorithm
    see how to build a linear regression model by TensorFlow
```

### neural_network.py
```
    Now we have a task: classify the flowers! just by a three-layers neural network!
    the model is like:
    input layer:     @ @ @ @
    hidden layer:  @ @ @ @ @ @
    output layer:     @ @ @
    the data comes from iris data set
```
